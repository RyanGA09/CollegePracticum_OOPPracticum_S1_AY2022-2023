# College Practicum - Object Oriented Programming First Half Semester (AY 2022 - 2023)

This project is part of the Object-Oriented Programming practicum during the first half of the Academic Year 2022 - 2023. The focus of this project is to implement and apply the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java programming language. The goal of this practicum is to develop a deep understanding of core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and to apply these concepts in the development of efficient and well-structured software.

## Features
